# Deep mutational scan of human adenosine deaminase 

This deep mutational scan of human adenosine deaminase is in the early planning phase. Currently 

- have synthesized a gene and cloned into vector 
- expressed and purified, and optimized purification, in _Escherichia_ 
- developed low-cost, high-throughput manual assay 
- developed low-cost, high-throughput automated assay for Transcriptic (now defunct) 

Next steps

- computational deep mutation scan 
- feature generation 
- machine learning 
- error prone PCR protocol 
- nicking/Kunkel/NNK oligo design and protocol 
- Neat sequencing
